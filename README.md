# Eclipse Thingweb App

This repository contains a Flutter app built upon the Eclipse Thingweb project
`dart_wot`.
It illustrates how to use the W3C Web of Things specifications to create an app
that is capable of interacting with Things using HTTP, MQTT, and CoAP.

At the moment, the app supports all non-Web platforms (i.e., Android, iOS,
macOS, Linux, and Windows), although support for secure communication using
CoAP is currently limited.
